-- Charlotte Esthy — OPTIONAL defence-in-depth: PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
--
-- By default tenant isolation is enforced in the server data layer: every query is
-- scoped by the business_id of the authenticated session (src/lib/auth.ts, src/lib/api.ts)
-- and covered by automated tests. This file adds a second, database-level barrier.
--
-- HOW TO USE (not enabled automatically):
--   1. Apply this file once:   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/rls/enable_rls.sql
--   2. Connect the app as a NON-superuser role that is a member of `ce_app`
--      (superusers always bypass RLS):
--          CREATE ROLE ce_login LOGIN PASSWORD '...' IN ROLE ce_app;
--   3. Wrap each request's queries in a transaction that first runs
--          select set_config('app.business_id', '<business uuid>', true);
--      (this requires a small change to src/db/index.ts — see README "Row Level Security").
--
-- With the setting missing, policies match no rows (fail closed).
-- Global tables (users, sessions, password_resets) are not business-owned and are not covered.
